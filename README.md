Aim -> (A) To print hello world command.
(B) To make a calculator.

Theory -> C++ is a high level object-oriented programming language. It is also known as "C with class".
It was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup in 1979.
It implements all the OOPs concepts.
It is a compiled language.

(A) To print an output in C++ we use cout command.
Syntax: cout<<value_to_print<<value_to_print;

(B) Basic arithematic operations like addition, subtravtion, multiplication and division can be performed.
To take input from the user, we use "cin" command.

Output (A):

Syntax: cin>>value_to_be_entered;

Conclusion -> In this experiment, I learnt about C++ programming lnguage, its basic commands and also made a program for calculator.
